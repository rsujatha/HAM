To get the shortened data just run following commands sequentially

"python saving_important_columns.py"
"python extracting_required_data.py"

NOTE: above commands assume that yang* file and out* file is already present in the current directory


To generate the output file for Part 3.1 run following command

"python abundance_matching.py"

This generates a text file with columns "Mass Luminosity X Y Z" in respective units 
(This is different order as compared to the temp files generated in previous python codes)
